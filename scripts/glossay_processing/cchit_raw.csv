CCR application supports the maintenance of local and national registries for clinical and resource tracking of care for patients with certain clinical conditions. At this time, Hepatitis C (CCR:HEPC) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (CCR:HIV) registries are available. This application contains important demographic and clinical data on all VHA patients with these conditions, and provides many capabilities to VA facilities that provide care and treatment to patients with these conditions, including clinical categorization of patients and automatic transmission of data to the VA's National Case Registry. It also provides clinical and administrative reports for local medical center use. CCR accesses several other Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) files that contain information regarding other diagnoses, prescriptions, surgical procedures, laboratory tests, radiology exams, patient demographics, hospital admissions, and clinical visits. This access allows identified clinical staff to take advantage of the wealth of data supported through VistA.
The Clinical Case Registries (CCR) application collects data on the population of veterans with certain clinical conditions, namely hepatitis C and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. This version of the CCR software has been significantly redesigned to provide access to the HIV Registry (CCR:HIV) and Hepatitis C Registry (CCR:HEPC) from a single interface. CCR has also been enhanced by automation of the data collection system and transformed from an administrative database into a clinically relevant tool for patient management.
Data from the registries is used for both clinical and administrative reporting on both a local and national level. Each facility can produce local reports (information related to patients seen in their system). Reports from the national database are used to monitor clinical and administrative trends, including issues related to patient safety, quality of care, and disease evolution across the national population of patients. The registries at each facility will store selected HIV and Hepatitis C data from 1985 to the present CCR provides these key features:
- Automates the development of a local list of patients with evidence of HIV or Hepatitis C infection.
- Automatically transmits patient data from the local registry lists to a national database.
- Provides robust reporting capabilities."

The main function of this software is to capture data for patients meeting specified conditions. All monitors within the framework of this software are ultimately based upon patient related data. In order to capture data, you create monitors that run nightly. These nightly runs ""auto enroll"" (or capture) the patients defined by the monitors.
This system looks at what happened yesterday in VISTA. It can capture such items as ward, treating specialty, SSN, age, etc. For a more extensive list of items, use the Data Element File Inquire option within the Outputs Menu of the Monitoring System Manager Menu. Data elements available for capture vary depending on the conditions you select when building monitors.
Conditions are provided with the Clinical Monitoring System package. Examples of conditions include ON WARD, READMISSION, MAS MOVEMENT TYPE, PREVIOUS DISCHARGE, etc. You may use the Condition File Inquire option to obtain information on selected/all conditions. The information provided will describe the condition; tell you what questions will be asked when using a condition; tell you when you must define a group for the condition, and list the other data that is available for capture."
Clinical Reminder,"The Clinical Reminder system helps caregivers deliver higher quality care to patients for both preventive health care and management of chronic conditions, and helps ensure that timely clinical interventions are initiated.
Reminders assist clinical decision-making and also improve documentation and follow-up, by allowing providers to easily view when certain tests or evaluations were performed and to track and document when care has been delivered. They can direct providers to perform certain tests or other evaluations that will enhance the quality of care for specific conditions. The clinicians can then respond to the reminders by placing relevant orders or recording clinical activities on patients’ progress notes.
Clinical Reminders may be used for both clinical and administrative purposes. However, the primary goal is to provide relevant information to providers at the point of care, for improving care for veterans. The package benefits clinicians by providing pertinent data for clinical decision-making, reducing duplicate documenting activities, assisting in targeting patients with particular diagnoses and procedures or site-defined criteria, and assisting in compliance with VHA performance measures and with Health Promotion and Disease Prevention guidelines."

Capacity Management Tools (KMPR),"software is intended for use by Information Resource Management (IRM) staff responsible for the capacity planning functions at their site. The CM Tools software allows a site to collect VistA HL7 workload information.
The CM Tools software is strongly dependent on the site to schedule and run the background task on a regular basis. Menus and options are provided locally at the site to allow IRM staff to accomplish and monitor this task.
The background task obtains VistA HL7 information from the site and automatically transfers this data via network mail (i.e., VistA MailMan) to the Capacity Planning National Database.
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) developed the CM Tools software in order to obtain more accurate information regarding the current and future system and VistA HL7 workload at VA sites (e.g., VA Medical Centers [VAMCs]).
Installing the CM Tools software creates the collection process mechanism and other necessary components of the software. The fully automated data collection mechanism entails capturing the following data:
- VistA HL7 workload specifics at the site—This data is gathered into a temporary ^TMP(""KMPDH"",$J) collection global.
- Timing data at the site—This data is gathered into the temporary ^KMPTMP(""KMPDT"") collection global. The collection mechanism is continuously monitoring each process on the system while trapping system timing and VistA HL7 workload data."

data standardization,"Data Standardization is the foundation for data sharing. Standardization ensures that data can be shared across systems and that it will retain the same meaning in each system. Standardization will enable the exchange of clinically-relevant health data between the VA and its health partners, and other federal entities such as the Department of Defense (DoD), Health & Human Services (HHS), and the Indian Health Service (IHS). Standardization will also support development of an integrated, longitudinal patient record that will give providers access to the veteran’s complete health record. The result will be a safer, higher-quality and more cost-effective provision of care for veterans across all federal facilities. Standardization of data will also assist with DoD interoperability efforts by supporting a seamless transition of care for individuals moving from active-duty to veteran status.
As a result of a Congressional Mandate requiring a consolidated database of all veteran patient results, the VHA Office of Information and DoD were tasked with implementing a method to communicate entire patient records between the respective agencies. To accomplish this, VHA and DoD will use the standard recommended by Consolidated Health Informatics (CHI) for Clinical Document names — Logical Observation Identifier Names and Codes (LOINC®).
CHI is a collaborative effort to adopt health information interoperability standards, particularly health vocabulary and messaging standards, for implementation in Federal Government Systems. About 20 departments and agencies, including the DoD, HHS, and VHA, are active in the CHI governance process. The CHI initiative is one of the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) eGov initiatives."

The field definitions describe the type of data to be stored in the actual code sheet. The fields can be arranged in an input template in the order they will be used to create the code sheet. Once the code sheet data has been created, the code sheets can be marked for batching. Batching the code sheets will group like code sheets together for transmission. When the code sheets are transmitted, all code sheets within the batch will be transmitted in the same VA MailMan message. The exception to this is the Financial Management System (FMS) code sheets. When the FMS code sheets are created they are queued for transmission using the GENERIC CODE SHEET STACK file (#2100.1), thus bypassing the batching process.

IFCAP package automates functions in Acquisition and Materiel Management (A&MM), Fiscal and for all VA Services that request supplies and services. The goal of IFCAP is to integrate these three areas and allow users to share procurement and financial information.
IFCAP consists of several functional components, each responsible for a similar set of tasks:
- FUNDS DISTRIBUTION allows Fiscal Service to establish Fund Control Points, and track funding for budget purposes.
- CONTROL POINT ACTIVITY automates the preparation of requests, the electronic transmission of requests to A&MM and Fiscal services and the bookkeeping processes within a service.
- PROCUREMENT allows A&MM to transfer IFCAP-generated requests onto purchase orders and requisitions, process receiving documents in the warehouse, and create and transmit code sheets to Austin.
- ACCOUNTING automates the creation of code sheets, handles the processing of certified invoices, and facilitates the electronic transmission of code sheets and receiving documents to the Financial Management System (FMS) located in Austin, Texas. In addition, IFCAP transfers obligation information back to the Control Point and updates the Control Point balance automatically.
- INVENTORY permits services to maintain their own on-line inventory and establish an average stock level, record the distribution of goods to secondary location(s), and automatically generate IFCAP requests for replenishment purposes. Secondary locations may maintain their own inventory if they wish.
- RFQ enables the Purchasing Agent (PA) to create a Request for Quotation (RFQ), evaluate bids, award the order, and generate the purchase order. Using IFCAP and the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) functionality that currently exists in Austin, the PA can electronically send the RFQ to one or many vendors and receive the bids electronically
- PURCHASE CARD permits users at Service level and in A&MM to generate purchase orders against assigned credit card(s). Charges are passed electronically from the Austin Credit Card System (CCS) to IFCAP and users reconcile payments with IFCAP Purchase Orders. The assigned Approving Official then approves reconciled orders. The local IFCAP Purchase Card Registration file is maintained by the station designated Purchase Card Coordinator. Reconciled orders are then approved by assigned Approving Officials. There are many reports that provide data on the status of the purchase card orders and timeliness of the reconciliation and approval processes.
- DELIVERY ORDERS permits users to generate purchase orders for contract items at the Service-level. Using switches that are site configurable, orders can bypass Fiscal and be obligated at time of signing by Service-level staff.

The MPI is the authoritative source for a patient's ICN and the ICN is the enterprise-wide identifier for a veteran and the key to accessing a patient's record across multiple databases.
Creates an index that uniquely identifies each active patient treated by the Veterans Administration and to identify the VHA facilities where a patient is receiving care.

NHE,"Network Health Exchange
NHE was developed at the Chicago Westside Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) and has evolved over several iterations. The NHE is a VistA component that provides clinicians with quick and easy access to patients' information from any site where they have been treated. NHE provides the computer mechanism for VAMC clinicians to retrieve clinical patient data from other medical centers. The requester is notified of returned patient data through an alert that appears with the VistA menu system. Patient data is displayed in a format similar to the integrated clinical reports found in Health Summary and can be viewed onscreen or printed.
The NHE software accesses several VistA files which contain information concerning clinic visits, diagnoses, prescriptions, laboratory tests, radiology exams, and hospital admissions. It enables clinicians to request a total or brief medical or pharmacy record for a specified patient from a specified site or sites. This permits clinical staff to take advantage of the vast amount of clinical data supported through VistA.
NHE is based on the Health Summary software. However, NHE does not make calls to Health Summary so it is not necessary for a site to have Health Summary installed in order to use NHE nor is familiarity with Health Summary required in order to use NHE.
The NHE is another tool, similar to Patient Data Exchange (PDX). As compared to PDX, however, NHE offers fewer retrieval options and requires less input by the user, resulting in simpler, faster access to patient data.
The NHE was the first phase of the MPI/Patient Demographics (MPI/PD project, which was formerly known as the Clinical Information Resource Network [CIRN] Project). The primary goal of the MPI/PD project is to assure full access to patients' information for primary care providers, regardless of location of care. NHE was released as an interim bridge to a more fully integrated clinical patient data exchange system."

It is both roll-and-scroll- and GUI-based software that undergoes a quality assurance process to ensure conformity with namespacing and other VistA standards and conventions (see SAC).
Server-side code is written in M, and, via Kernel, runs on all major M implementations regardless of vendor. Client-side code is written in Java or Borland Delphi and runs on the Microsoft operating system."
VistA Toaster,"is an appliance (virtual machine) consisting of VistA, GT.M and Linux that runs under QEMU (http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/), which enables the toaster to operate under Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.
QEMU - open source processor emulator. QEMU is an emulator for various CPUs. It works on Linux, Windows, FreeBSD and Mac OS X.
QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.
When used as a machine emulator, QEMU can run OSes and programs made for one machine (e.g. an ARM board) on a different machine (e.g. your own PC). By using dynamic translation, it achieves very good performances.
When used as a virtualizer, QEMU achieves near native performances by executing the guest code directly on the host CPU. A host driver called the QEMU accelerator (also known as KQEMU) is needed in this case. The virtualizer mode requires that both the host and guest machine use x86 compatible processors."
VistALink 1.5,"VistALink 1.5 resource adapter is a transport layer that provides communication between HealtheVet-VistA Java applications and VistA/M servers, in both client-server and n-tier environments. It allows Java applications to execute remote procedure calls (RPCs) on the VistA/M system and retrieve results, synchronously. VistALink 1.5 is also referred to as “VistALink J2M.”
VistALink consists of Java-side adapter libraries and an M-side listener:
- The adapter libraries use the J2EE Connector Architecture (J2CA 1.0) specification to integrate Java applications with legacy systems.
- The M listener process receives and processes requests from client applications."
VistAWeb,"is an intranet web application used to review remote patient information found in VistA and the HDR databases. To a large extent, VistAWeb mirrors the reports behavior of the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) and Remote Data View (RDV). However, by permitting a more robust and timely retrieval of remote-site patient data, VistAWeb is also an enhancement to CPRS/RDV.
There are three ways to access VistAWeb. VistAWeb can be made available by adding it to the CPRS Tools Menu, and it can be selected as the default method of retrieving data from the Remote Data Available button in CPRS. These two methods are referred to as CPRS-spawned versions of VistAWeb. They are compliant with the HL7 Clinical Context Object Workgroup (CCOW) standards and therefore maintain context with the patient selected in CPRS. As a third option, VistAWeb can be accessed in a standalone mode by entering the uniform resource locator (URL) link (https://vistaweb.med.va.gov/) in the Internet Explorer address bar. Эти методы совместимы"
Vitals application,"The Vitals application is designed to collect the vital signs and measurements that are associated with a patient's hospital stay or outpatient clinic visit, and store the data in the patient's electronic medical record. Data can be accessed by several VistA applications that interface with the Vitals/Measurements application, such as CPRS, Health Summary, and Pharmacy. The Vitals module is used to enter vitals data, create user templates, view allergies, mark incorrect vitals as entered in error, and edit user preferences for data display on the vitals data table. The Vitals module also allows users to print several different Vitals reports.
Vitals has been made CCOW-compliant and can now synchronize with other CCOW-compliant VistA applications.

VRQ,"FMS Vendor Request document.
When a new vendor is added to IFCAP a VRQ message is sent electronically to the Austin FMS Vendor unit to determine if the vendor exists in the central vendor system. If the vendor is not in the system, Austin will confirm information and establish the vendor in the central file. If vendor exists in central file already, Austin will verify the data. See also VUP."

WorldVistA,"WorldVistA was formed to extend and collaboratively improve the VistA electronic health record and health information system for use outside of its original setting. The system was originally developed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for use in its veterans hospitals, outpatient clinics, and nursing homes. WorldVistA has a number of development efforts aimed at adding new software modules such as pediatrics, obstetrics, and other functions not used in the veterans' healthcare setting. WorldVistA seeks to help those who choose to adopt the VistA system to successfully master, install, and maintain the software for their own use. WorldVistA will strive to guide VistA adopters and programmers towards developing a community based on principles of open, collaborative, peer review software development and dissemination.
